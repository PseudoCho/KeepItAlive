First attempt at coding a game for Ludum Dare #46. Didn't meet deadline so I will use this as learning opportunity and finish the game.

No frameworks.
No sound.
Sprite animation to be included.

1. Make a game
2. Clown has to live
3. We control the clown
4. Clown moves in a canvas area
5. Make this game like Yena's poop game
6. Keep track of score
7. W A S D (or left, right, up, down)
8. x and y coordinates of two object types - player clown and deadly objects

Next: Text(?) based adventure game using jewelrpg pics as canvas backgrounds


Random poop falls from the sky

Something like-

-Draw (along with ctx.canvas) poop images:
Initialise poop in array
For i in lengthof(array)
Draw poop - standardised srcx,srcy,width,height and randomised start x,y and y-5 each frame

*Do 1 poop first
